# DESCRIPTION
This is a simple movie ticket booking system that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater using a local API. This application fetches a list of movies from a server and displays them in a list. When a user clicks on a movie, the application will send a request to the server to update the ticket count. Once the ticket has been booked, the available ticket count will be updated in the movie details.
